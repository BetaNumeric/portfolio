PLACE YOUR ASSETS HERE

When you duplicate the `_template` folder, rename both the folder in `projects/` AND this folder in `public/projects/` to match.

For example, if you name your project `my-new-art`, you should have:
- `projects/my-new-art/index.md`
- `public/projects/my-new-art/`

Put all your images and videos for the project in this folder (e.g., `header.jpg`, `loop.mp4`).

In your `index.md`, reference them like this:
`/projects/my-new-art/header.jpg`
